# Song Search

# Description
This application uses the iTunes API to search songs and display the data recieved. It takes user input and creates an API call to iTunes displaying the JSON result dynamically. Song Search uses props in React to pass the data from the parent compontent to the child. Programming with React creates modular and readable code that is easy to understand. 


# Tutorial

I created this app with the help of [iLoveCoding's](https://ilovecoding.org/) React course. In this course I was introduced to React including its most powerful concepts: props, state, and components.
